# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as members, contributors, and leaders, promise to make participation in our community free from harassment for everyone. This includes people of all ages, body sizes, visible or invisible disabilities, ethnicities, sex characteristics, gender identities and expressions, levels of experience, education, socio-economic statuses, nationalities, personal appearances, races, religions, sexual identities, and orientations.

We promise to act and interact in ways that make our community open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy.

## Our Standards

Good behavior that helps create a positive environment includes:

- Showing empathy and kindness toward others
- Being respectful of different opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and accepting constructive feedback graciously
- Taking responsibility for our mistakes, apologizing to those affected, and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best for the community as a whole, not just ourselves

Bad behavior that is not acceptable includes:

- Using sexualized language or imagery, and making sexual advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting, or making derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Harassing others publicly or privately
- Sharing others' private information, like physical or email addresses, without their permission
- Any other behavior that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for explaining and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior. They will take fair and appropriate action in response to any behavior they consider inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct. They will communicate reasons for their decisions when necessary.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all community spaces and also applies when an individual is representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official email address, posting from an official social media account, or acting as a representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior can be reported to the community leaders. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders must respect the privacy and security of the person who reported the incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these guidelines to decide the consequences for actions that violate this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction
